# Data-Analysis-on-IBM-Employee-Attrition-
The Dataset is from IBM human resources and has information about employee attrition. I am working on this dataset to understand the underlying reasons why people leave.
In the same respect, studying this dataset allows one to understand what a company is doing correctly to retain talent. 

I emplored the dataset to see if there was statistical significance between employee well-being measurements and employee attrition. 
some of the areas that i looked at were the attrition rates related to department, total working years, years since last promotion, years with current manager, and job level. 
In addition, I looked at different following areas of satisfaction:job, environment, relationship, work-life balance.

The project is intended to provide insight that the human resources department can use to lower attrition rates where conflict exists. 

In order to do my analysis, I split the dataset into those that left the company and those who stayed. Through use of statistical analysis, I created bar graphs that showed how different
employee well being measurements and attrition behaved. 

I used python to write my code because I needed to apply my code to hundreds of observations. Data Wrangling and visualizations also allowed me to explore the dataset and find insight. 
I obtained the P-value and T-test to see if there is a statistical significance. 

While making the project, I learned that those who work in the sales department have the highest attrition rate. Many in the sales department have a lower job level and report a low relationship satisfaction.
There was a statistical significance showing that people leave for a higher job level and salary. 

If more data is available in the future, I would like to merge it and conduct more analysis.
